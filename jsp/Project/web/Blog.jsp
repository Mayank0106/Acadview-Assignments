    <h1> <b>FANTASTIC MEMORIES THAT WE CHERISH, WITH YOU.</h1></b><br><br><br>

<p>As the merry began to sing, and carols filled warm the chilly air, we at My Event Planner had long since started celebrating this busy festive season, featuring banquets, parties, masquerade balls, dinners, and private functions. We?ve assured our clients of their festive cheer.

December 1st marked the first of a timeline of great events, as we hosted the first staff event in a beautiful, cozy, and elegant hall for their staff banquet. Decorated with green strobe lights, banners, backdrops, and a perfectly laid out dining hall, it was a wonderful dinner that would leave spectators green with envy.

Shortly after, a corporate client celebrated with a golden winter wonderland, and too many goodies to eat! We?ve filled a hall full of golden bows, flowers, and what else? Snow! The guests tiptoed right across the frosty white halls, to sit down for a buffet dinner of Christmas delights, accompanied by the joyous live music and carols.

Another corporate client partied at the Club Lounge in Sliema with an Oscar-themed late-lunch drinks. Guests walked in via a VIP red-carpet isle to trendy tunes being mixed by the DJ, as a Polaroid photographer snapped away! These VIPs were treated to an afternoon of luxury, champagne, and great style ? and décor too!

Many more events came to pass, and along came another cozy, cheerful Christmas event. Under a hundred antique lights, and a gorgeous vintage setting, our clients celebrated their festive season with a fully-stocked and specialised open bar, scrumptious finger food, and some great music. Simple, yet timeless and ever so elegant.

An unforgettable night was planned out for another one of our clients, as they entered a gorgeous and golden hall, to the sweet sound of a saxophonist as they paced round the room decorated with stream lights, and gorgeous red poinsettias. The event enveloped the traditional, with the classic, as well as modern, through the vibrance of the gorgeous red flowers, the wines, tasty finger food, and the soothing sensations played by the saxophonist.</p>


<p><b>THE 5 MUST-HAVES FOR ANY SUCCESSFUL EVENT</b></p>
<img src="success.jpg" alt="Success" class="Success">


<p>1)Motivation:</p>
<p>There must be a reason for why you are doing your event, so find the reason and understand what your crowd will be looking for, especially what kind of event you want to deliver and why you are currently developing your event.</p>


<p>2)Idea</p>
<p>Now that you know what you are trying to do, you need to shine above the rest. How do you do this? Bouncy castle at a wedding? Upside down cakes hanging? Mermaids? Party in the middle of St Elmo?s? Maybe a masseur in the middle of your venue, to the sound of a live saxophonist. We?ve done this all (and more!) before, and we?ve got you covered for everything.</p>

<p>3)Knowing your crowd</p>
<p>Understand the kind of people you are trying to attract or that you are trying to impress. What is the age of those attending? What do they like? Right now it?s key that reflect upon these questions so as to know who you are catering for.</p>


<p>4)Venue</p>
<p>This is the first real step in making your event legendary, classic, and original; the event that everyone is going to want to organise. It starts from the location, it?s all about the location. We can get you almost any place if you think ahead of time, most places have permits which can be obtained if you know the right people. (That?s us for those who are wondering) Sorting the event location, will then lead you to setting the?</p>
 
<p>5)Ambience</p>
<p>Once a venue is settled, the ambience and venue?s atmosphere should be taken highly into consideration. Whether this is in fairy lights, tiki torches, spotlights or flood lights, lighting in combination with décor are fillers of negative space as well as focal points around a venue, and work towards setting the mood for what you want to achieve at your event. Rest assured, that this is what makes an event Instagram-worthy for your guests!</p>
